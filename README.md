# Number-Guessing-With-TimeLimit
## Rules: 
In the Time Limit Guessing Game implemented in the given code, there is one main role for the player:
1. **Player:** The role of the player is to interact with the game through the terminal (command-line interface). The player needs to guess the target number within the time limit of 10 seconds.

The player's actions in the game involve:

- Entering their guesses for the target number when prompted.
- Trying to guess the correct number within the given time frame.
- Reacting to hints provided by the game (e.g., "Try a higher number" or "Try a lower number") based on their guesses.
- Achieving the objective of guessing the correct number or recognizing when the time limit is reached and the game is over.

The game manager (represented by the `time_limit_guessing_game()` function) handles the game's logic and flow, generates the target number, starts the timer, and determines the game's outcome based on the player's input and the time limit.

As the code is designed to be a simple text-based guessing game, it doesn't involve any complex player roles or interactions beyond the player trying to guess the correct number within the time limit. The player's role is to enjoy the challenge of guessing the number while being under the constraint of the time limit.
